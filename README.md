# Programming-Projekt-HS

#####Programmier Projekt für die Hochschule Reutlingen



The **goal** of this project is for me to get several ciphers implemented. The ciphers I am thinking of are the Caesar
cipher, the Vigenère cipher and maybe one more. But also to decrypt the respective ciphers then without knowing the
secret. If this all works I would like it to be possible to encrypt and decrypt whole text files. For this reason I will
use Python for my project. Python also has many build-in methods and libraries that make it easier to work with strings
and the file system. But even if I can do that I still want to make a graphical user interface that allows to select
files to encrypt, enter texts and encrypt them with the selected ciphers and then save them as a file in a folder.

**Python** has therefore for me the clear advantage over C because of the lists, methods and the simpler strings. But also
the library Tkinter for the graphical interface.

The plan for this project is to first implement the simplest cipher, the Caesar cipher, and break it by algorithm. After
that we will implement the Vigenère cipher and try to break it. Next some code cleanup and the filesystem for saving and
creating files etc.. After that I will dig into the library Tkinter to create the graphical user interface and make a
quite simple one there. If this all worked out well and didn't lead to any problems yet. I will clean up the code again
and implement a third cipher algorithm and try to crack it. The goal is that in the end all are selectable and work when
encrypting and breaking a text.
